Write the algorithm for using an elevator. 

- From the lobby, step into the elevator when door opens
- Once elevator door closes:
    - Go up to the 12th floor (n=n+1)
    - Press the "12" button once
- If elevator stops at other floors
    - Remain inside elevator
    - Make room when more passengers enter
- Until elevator stops on 12th floor
    - Say "Excuse me" if there are many passengers
    - Exit elevator


Find a Real-Life Algorithm.

- Once alarm goes off
    + Turn off alarm clock
    + Sit up in 90 degree angle
    + Get out of bed
- After getting out of bed:
    + Grab blanket
    + Fold blanket in half along long-edge
    + Then bold again in half along long-edge
    + Place folded blanket at top center of bed
    + Place pillow on top of folded blanket
- If could not get out of bed
    + Snooze alarm clock
    + Close eyes for a little longer
    + Continue snoozing alarm clock until get out of bed
    + Perform steps after getting out of bed
