Week 6 - Review and Reflect


1. What are classes? Be sure to define the following terms in your explanation and describe the relationships between them:

    class: a template or model for how objects of the same type should behave
    state: also known as attributes, the characteristics, or data, of each instance
    behavior: member functions or methods
    instance variable: variable you call on an instance
    instance method: method you call on an instance

2. What are attributes? 
    Attributes are just a special sort of variable that you can use inside of a class declaration.

3. Give an example of a real world object, and describe how you might assign its attributes if you were to design a class to represent that object.
    The attributes of a vehicle might be described as its make, model, size, color, or year.

4. What is the purpose of the initialize method? When does it run?
    The initialize method assigns default values into all of the instance variables, and it is usually defined at the very beginning, right after declaring the class.
    
5. What are modules?
    Modules provide compartmentalization for methods.

6. What are the different ways you can use a module?
    You can use a module as a standalone module or as a mixins module.
