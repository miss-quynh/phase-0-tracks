# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
1. Version control is a system that records changes to a file over time, and it is useful because it allows you to recall specific versions later.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
1. A branch is the duplication of an object under revision control so that modifications can happen in parallel along both branches. You would use a branch so you can make as any changes as you'd like without disrupting the master branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
1. A commit records changes to the repository. A good commit message contains present-tense verb and detailed information of has been done previously.

* What is a merge conflict?
1. Merge conflicts will occur if competing changes are made to the same line of a file or when a file is deleted that another person is attempting to edit.
