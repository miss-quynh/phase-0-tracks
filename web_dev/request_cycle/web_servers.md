2) In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
    A virtual private server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system (OS), and customers may have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS. A couple advantages of using a VPS is affordability and accessibility, in which a user can have a lot more control over his or her virtual server than with shared hosting.

    It is considered a bad idea to run program as the root user in lieu of on a user level on a Linux system because it defeats the purpose of the additional layer, and thus the security flaw is exploited. Such vulnerability allows an attacker to have access to all data (e.g. documents and stored passwords) and directly control the hardware.
